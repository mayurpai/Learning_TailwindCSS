        I am Mayur Pai B H, a web developer, and programmer. An
        inquisitive-natured person who loves exploring routes that I've never
        come across. One of my favorite ways to learn is to teach. I'm pursuing
        my Bachelor's degree, a fourth-year engineering student in the stream of
        Information Science from Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management,
        Mangaluru. Ever since I was a little kid, Computers have fascinated me
        and have driven my passion and craze for them. Learning new things on a
        daily basis has always been my priority. I studied languages,
        algorithms, built up my technicality, leadership skills, and much more.
        There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet
        more to build.
